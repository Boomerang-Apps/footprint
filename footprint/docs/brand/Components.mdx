## Component Conventions

### Naming

- **Files:** PascalCase for components (`Button.tsx`), lowercase for Radix-based primitives (`tabs.tsx`)
- **Exports:** Named exports matching the file name
- **Props interfaces:** `I{ComponentName}Props` (e.g., `IButtonProps`)

### Structure

All components follow this pattern:

```
components/
  ui/              # Reusable UI primitives
  auth/            # Authentication flows
  layout/          # Page structure
  admin/           # Admin-only components
  checkout/        # Checkout flow
  product-config/  # Print customization
  gift/            # Gift features
  style-picker/    # AI style selection
  orders/          # Order-related
  account/         # User account
```

### RTL Support

- All components render correctly in RTL mode
- Use logical CSS properties (`margin-inline-start` over `margin-left`) where possible
- Tailwind RTL utilities: `rtl:` prefix for direction-specific overrides
- Test all components in both Hebrew (RTL) and English (LTR) modes

### Accessibility

- All interactive components have proper ARIA attributes
- Keyboard navigation support via Radix UI primitives
- Focus indicators use brand purple outline
- Color contrast meets WCAG AA standards (minimum 4.5:1 for text)
